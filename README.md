Uploading The Practice Easel

On the last day of each month (or, during a point when I have some downtime, and don't fancy attempting to push in further knowledge), I will take a few hours to make an attempt at cleaning up both the verbose amount of writing, and some of the more horrific looking pages!

As of the end of January 28th, currently on Lecture 227 of 578.  I estimate I will complete 36 lectures each week, which would have me completing the course by April 8th (I'll be attending a wedding that day)  I really hope I can pick up the pace with this!
