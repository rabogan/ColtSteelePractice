Uploading The Practice Easel

Being perfectly honest, the opening stages of this are going to be horrible to look at.  Some of the pages I'm creating (especially pre-CSS and pre-JS sections) will be hard to follow and difficult to read - at least, initially. 

On the last day of each month (or, during a point when I have some downtime, and don't fancy attempting to push in further knowledge), I will take a few hours to make an attempt at cleaning up both the verbose amount of writing, and some of the more horrific looking pages!
