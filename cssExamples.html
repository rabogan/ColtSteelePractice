<body>
    <p>The comments on this page explain the deficiencies of inline or use of the style element, We instead created a
        CSS file. As you should know, CSS follows one basic pattern:
        <br>
        selector{
        property: value;
        }
    </p>
    <!--
        INLINE STYLES
    A strongly non-recommended way of adding CSS is to do inline addition of styles
    <h1 style="color:purple">Hello</h1>
    <button style="background-color:palegreen">I am button</button>
    -->
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <button>I am button</button>
    <p>CSS seems fairly rudimentary, if huge in range</p>
    <p>Every course probably starts with colors. We can represent them using text, (e.g. purple), or
        RGB values, or hex, etc...
    </p>
    <h2>This is a h2, all with background-color changed using RGB, and text color changed using the hex #!
        <a href="https://coolors.co/">www.coolors.co</a> is
        one nice way of selecting color codes, either in RGB or hexadecimal.
    </h2>
    <h2>This is also h2</h2>
    <h2>Last h2</h2>
    <button>Button 1</button>
    <button>Button 2</button>
    <h3>Using common text properties</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In the h1, we're aligning the text to the center</li>
        <li>In the h1, we're also changing the font weight (boldness/lightness): 400 being normal, 700 being bold. H1 is
            usually bold, but is now set to 400</li>
        <li>Text decoration, or <em>text-decoration</em> is a way of setting the appearance of decorative lines on text!
            I've set
            h1 to be <strong>underlined</strong> in <strong>red</strong> with a <strong>wavy</strong> line!</li>
        <li>How to remove all underlines from web links? Well, just set text-decoration of the anchor (a) to none!</li>
        <li>To double-space your paragraphs (as below), set the line-height to 2!</li>
        <li>Letter-spacing adds some distance between letters! For this example, I added 15 pixels of letter-spacing in
            h1</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can look at different font families on <a>www.cssfontstack.com</a> Why font stack? Well, generally, we don't
        always know if our font will work across all machines (Windows, Mac, Chrome, whatever). So, in our font-family
        part of our specific element, we list a stack of fonts - in order from most preferred and specific, to most
        generic. font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif</p>
    <p>At a later point, we will include custom fonts, and guarantee that the user will be able to access them (possibly
        at the expense of loading time)</p>
