        </div>
        <h2><em>flex-basis, flex-grow, and flex-shrink</em></h2>
        <p>All of these properties are used to control the size and behavior of flexbox items. When used with other
            flexbox properties like <strong>flex-direction</strong>, <strong>align-items</strong> and
            <strong>justify-content</strong>, these properties can be used to create flexible and responsive layout.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>flex-basis</strong> sets the initial size of a flex item before any addition space (or
                shrinking) is distributed/applied. It can be set to a specific value (e.g.
                <strong>flex-basis:200px;</strong>) or a percentage of the available space (e.g.
                <strong>flex-basis:50%;</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>flex-grow</strong> controls how much a flex item should grow relative to other flex items: i.e.
                <strong>flex-grow</strong> controls the amount of available space an element should take up. For
                example, if one flex item has a <strong>flex-grow</strong> value of 2 and another has a value of 1, the
                first item will take up twice as much space as the second. It'w usually a positive number that
                represents the proportion of available space, e.g. <strong>flex-grow:2;</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>flex-shrink</strong> is deployed on items larger than the container - when there is not enough
                space in the container. This property
                controls how much a flex item should shrink relative to other flex items, and (as with
                <strong>flex-grow</strong> is a positive number that represents the proportion of available space that
                should be taken away from the item. For example, if one flex item has a <strong>flex-shrink</strong>
                value of 2 and another has a value of 1, the first item will shrink twice as much as the second.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>flex-basis</em></h3>
        <li><strong>flex-basis</strong> is changed using units! The top image has no flex-basis change. The lower, more
            stretched image has <strong>flex-basis:333px;</strong>
            <h4><strong>flex-basis:333px;</strong></h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/flexboxImages/flex-basis-example1.png" alt="flex-basis">
                <figcaption><em>flex-basis:333px;</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4><strong>flex-basis:333px;</strong></h4>
            <p>In this example, the flex-direction is in the column direction! Look at the different between no
                flex-basis and when a flex-basis of 333px; is applied!</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/flexboxImages/flex-basis-example2.png" alt="flex-basis">
                <figcaption><em>flex-basis:333px;</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </li>
        <h3><em>flex-grow</em></h3>
        <li><strong>flex-grow</strong> uses a unit-less value. Look at the effect different values have on the separate
            divs! I've used <strong>div:nth-of-type()</strong> to help show this.
            <h4><strong>flex-grow:1;</strong></h4>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/flexboxImages/flex-grow-example.png" alt="flex-grow">
                <figcaption><em>Notice how the growth is markedly different!</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <pre>
            <code>
                #container div {
                    width: 200px;
                    height: 200px;
                    flex-basis:200px;
                }
                
                div:nth-of-type(1){
                  flex-grow:1;
                }

                div:nth-of-type(5){
                    flex-grow:1;  (2nd image)  
                    /*vs flex-grow:2; (3rd image)*/
                }
            </code>
            </pre>
            Notice how things scale and stack. These will be able to grow. To prevent over-growing, you can assign a
            max-width too. In the 3rd image, we changed things slightly so that the growth of div 5 is twice that of div
            1. Notice how the elements can get so much larger when adjusting the size of the display!
        </li>
        <h3><em>flex-shrink</em></h3>
        <li>The <strong>flex-basis</strong> has been changed to 600px to help demonstrate this one too!
            <h4><strong>flex-shrink:2;</strong></h4>
            <p>This will make the affected div shrink by <strong>twice</strong> the usual shrink rate.
                flex-shrink:4; will affect the div's shrinkage by 4 times the rate. So div 1 will shrink twice as much
                as the middle 3 divs, while div 5 shrinks four times as fast!</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/flexboxImages/flex-shrink-ex1.png" alt="flex-shrink">

        </li>
        <h2>Flex shorthand</h2>
        <p><strong><em>flex-basis, flex-grow, and flex-shrink</em></strong> are used so frequently that special
            shorthand has been developed to help use them effectively.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>One value (unitless number) means <strong>flex-grow</strong> is being changed.
                <em>e.g.</em><strong>flex:2;</strong>
            </li>
            <li>One value with units (<em>e.g.</em><strong>flex:2;</strong> or <strong>flex:10em;</strong> or
                <strong>flex:30%;</strong>) means we are changing the width and height - thus,
                <strong>flex-basis</strong> is affected. Another common example is <strong>flex:min-content;</strong>.
                It tells the flex item to take up the minimum amount of space required to fit its content. This means
                that the item will shrink down to the size of its content, rather than using the value specified in the
                flex-basis property.

                For example, if a flex item has a flex-basis value of 200px and its content only takes up 150px, the
                item will take up 150px of space if flex-basis:min-content is used. This can be useful in situations
                where the content of the item is dynamic and may change in size, or when you want to ensure that the
                item only takes up as much space as it needs to.

                Keep in mind that when the flex-basis is set to min-content, the flex-item will only be shrinked to
                minimum size of its contents and if the contents is not big enough to fill the parent container the
                container may not be filled up and would leave some empty spaces.
            </li>
            <li>Two values, where both are <strong>unitless</strong> mean that the <strong>flex-grow</strong> and
                <strong>flex-shrink</strong> are being used. (<em>e.g.</em><strong>flex:2 2;</strong>)
            </li>
            <li>Two values, where the latter has been given units means that the <strong>flex-grow</strong> and
                <strong>flex-basis</strong> are changed. (<em>e.g.</em><strong>flex:2 30px;</strong>) Here is a brief
                image-based summary so far:
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/flexboxImages/flex-shorthand-1.png" alt="flex-shorthand">
                    <figcaption><em>See how introducing flex at all changes everything!</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>
            <li>Three values are used this order: <strong>flex-grow</strong>, then <strong>flex-shrink</strong>, then
                <strong>flex-basis</strong>. (<em>e.g.</em><strong>flex:2 2 10%;</strong>)
            </li>
            <li>Finally, global values are sometimes used in the flex shorthand. They come in the form of
                <strong>flex:inherit;</strong>,
                <strong>flex:initial;</strong>, and <strong>flex:unset;</strong>
            </li>
        </ol>
