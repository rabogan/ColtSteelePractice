    <p>This page will use styleExampleTwo.css, and is geared towards Section 7 of the course</p>
    <h2>Basic Selectors: Universal and Element Selectors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First covered: the <strong>universal</strong> selector (*) is shown, but its use is not recommended. It
            basically tries to
            change all elements on the page, so doesn't really meet our needs very often</li>
        <li>The <strong>element selector</strong> (e.g. button/h1 etc...) will changes all elements</li>
        <li>**NEW** The <strong>selector list</strong>, which uses a format like h1,h2{ ... } allows us to style both h1
            and h2</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ID Selectors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We can use the # id to single in on individual elements (and not just blanket). Before this, I changed the
            body background-color to #f1faee. The button background-color and font-size were adjusted as well!</li>
        <li>We wanted ONE specific button, the signup button to have a different color scheme. To do so, I changed the
            css associated with the id of that signup id</li>
        <li>One HUGELY important thing: an ID should only be used ONCE on a single HTML page. We shouldn't overuse IDs,
            but there's no need to avoid using them. A handful on a single page seems to be optimum, but class selectors
            are much more common</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Class Selectors (Lecture 71)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The first thing that is changed from the original document, is to change the span. (A reminder that span is
            a generic inline element). To select ALL spans in the document, use ALT and CLICK on it. ALT+CLICK is for
            Windows...</li>
        <li>I named the class '.tag'. It was given a different background-color, font-size, and color</li>
        <li>Class itself can be applied across a variety of different elements - and is used FAR MORE often than ID
            selectors</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Descendent Selector</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For example, we can choose to select all &lt;a&gt;s that are nested inside an &lt;li&gt;. To do so, we can
            use li a{ ... }</li>
        <li>So, no li tags would be styled in this...ONLY anchor tags &lt;a&gt; that are inside an &lt;li&gt; tag</li>
        <li>What happened with this example, is that each section below had a class 'post' appended to it. All anchor
            tags within that class post were then changed according to the attributes defined within the class</li>
        <li>Finally, a footer a (generic element selector+element selector descendent selecting) was used in CSS to
            changed the color of those particular links</li>
    </ul>
