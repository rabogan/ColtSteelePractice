<body>
    <p>This page will use styleExampleTwo.css, and is geared towards Section 7 of the course</p>
    <h2>Basic Selectors: Universal and Element Selectors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First covered: the <strong>universal</strong> selector <strong>*</strong> is shown, but its use is not
            recommended. It
            basically tries to
            change all elements on the page, so doesn't really meet our needs very often</li>
        <li>The <strong>element selector</strong> (e.g. <em>button</em>/<em>h1</em> etc...) will changes all elements of
            that type</li>
        <li>The obvious example is something like a <em>h1</em>{ ... } - all <em>h1</em> elements will have the ...
            attributes adjusted
        </li>
        <li>However, using a <strong>,</strong><em>(comma)</em> to separate elements is also acceptable. For example,
            h1+h2{...} means <em>h1</em> <strong>AND</strong> <em>h2</em> will have their attributes adjusted. Later on
            in
            this section,
            you'll see that ID-types and class-types can be represented in the same way. Using a class "complete" or
            id
            "example", the following could also work: .complete+h1{...} #id+h1{...}</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ID Selectors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We can use the # id to single in on individual elements which use them <strong>inline</strong>. In my
            example, I changed the
            page <em>body</em>'s <em>background-color</em> to #f1faee. Both of the <em>button</em></li>'s
        <em>background-color</em> and <em>font-size</em> were adjusted as well!</li>
        <li>We wanted ONE specific button (the Sign Up button) to have a different color scheme. To do so, I added an id
            called 'signup' to that specific button element, and then changed the
            attributes associated with that id name. So, something like <em>#signup{...}</em> is used in the css file
        </li>
        <li>One HUGELY important thing: an id of a <strong>specific name</strong> should only be used
            <strong>once</strong> on a single HTML page. We shouldn't overuse id selectors,
            but there's no need to avoid using them. A handful on a single page seems to be optimum, but class selectors
            are much more common
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Class Selectors (Lecture 71)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The first thing that is changed from the original document, is to change the <em>span</em>. (A reminder that
            <em>span</em> is
            a generic inline element). To select ALL spans in the document, use <strong>ALT and CLICK</strong> on it.
            ALT+CLICK is for
            Windows...
        </li>
        <li>I named the class <em>.tag</em>. It was given a different <em>background-color</em>, <em>font-size</em>, and
            <em>color</em>
        </li>
        <li>Class itself can be applied across a variety of different elements - and is used FAR MORE often than ID
            selectors</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Descendant Selector</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The SPACE between elements in the css file is very important!</li>
        <ul>
            <li>h1<strong>,</strong>h2 {...} : the comma means h1 AND h2</li>
            <li>h1 h2{...}: the <strong>space</strong> means any <strong>descendant <em>h2</em> INSIDE OF
                </strong><em>h1</em> will have attributes adjusted</li>
        </ul>
        <li>As another example, we can choose to select all &lt;a&gt;s elements that are nested inside an &lt;li&gt;
            element. To do so, we can
            use li a{ ... }</li>
        <li>So, no li tags would be styled in this...ONLY anchor tags &lt;a&gt; that are inside an &lt;li&gt; tag</li>
        <li>In the code of this page, one section below has a class 'post' appended to it. All anchor
            tags within that class post were then changed according to the attributes defined within the class. This
            uses <em>.post a</em>{...} in the CSS file</li>
        <li>Finally, a <em>footer a</em> (any <em>a</em> found INSIDE OF (or descending from) <em>footer</em>) was used
            in
            CSS to change the color of those particular links</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Combinator (Adjacent Selector/Adjacent Sibling Selected) and Direct Child/Direct Descendant Selector</h2>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>h1<strong>,</strong>h2 {...} : the comma means h1 AND h2</li>
            <li>h1 h2{...}: the <strong>space</strong> means any <strong>descendant <em>h2</em> INSIDE OF
                </strong><em>h1</em> will have attributes adjusted</li>
            <li>h1<strong>+</strong>h2{...}: the <strong>+</strong> sign means any <em>h2</em> <strong>immediately
                    preceded by</strong> <em>h1</em> will have its attributes adjusted</li>
            <li>h1<strong>&gt;</strong>h2{...} the <strong>&gt;</strong> sign denotes that any <em>h2</em> element that
                is a
                DIRECT CHILD (as opposed to a non-direct descendant nested deeply inside of) a <em>h1</em> element will
                have its
                attributes adjusted</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The h1+p {...} in the lecture's example is known as a COMBINATOR. It will <strong>ONLY</strong> change
            paragraphs immediately preceded by h1</em></li>
        <li>In our page's example, any button that follows input, as well as any <em>button</em> following a <em>h2</em>
            has been changed
            to slightly more garish colors</li>
        <li><strong>Child/Direct Descendant</strong> Selectors are quite easy. They make use of the &gt; sign, as in
            footer &gt; a, in my CSS file! Essentially, it demands that ONLY direct descendants of a specific selector
            are looked at. In this page, <em>footer a</em> should yield red links, while <em>footer &gt; a</em> should
            yield blue ones</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Attribute Selector</h2>
    <h4><em>Examples</em></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>input[type="text"]{...}: This selects all &lt;<em>input</em>&gt; elements where the <strong>type
                attribute</strong>
            is set to <em>text</em></li>
        <li>input[type="password]{...}: This selects all &lt;<em>input</em>&gt; elements where the <strong>type
                attribute</strong> is set to <em>password</em></li>
        <li>section[class="post"]{...}: This selects all &lt;<em>input</em>&gt; elements where the <strong>class
                attribute</strong> is set to <em>post</em></li>
        <li>a[href="https://www.rabogan.github.io"]{...}: This selects all &lt;<em>a</em>&gt; elements where the
            <strong>href attribute</strong> matches the www.rabogan.github.io website
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A little uncommon, the above allows us to select all elements that contain a <strong>SPECIFIC
                ATTRIBUTE</strong>, such as all inputs of type 'password' (let's say you want to change the text color
            of the password input)</li>
        <li>There are multiple attribute selectors (most rarely used), such as:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>element1<em>=</em>[attribute="example"] <em>=</em> used in this way denotes a DIRECT match</li>
            <li>element1<em>*=</em>[attribute="example"] <em>*=</em> denotes a 'fuzzy' match. So, if a href contains
                even the word 'goo', that could take you to google, goodbar, gooner4lyfe etc...</li>
            <li>element1<em>$=</em>[attribute="example"] <em>$=</em> used likes this means that the match for an element
                <em>element1</em> must end with example. Most used in websites!
            </li>
            <li>...<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors">and many many
                    more!!!</a></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>PSEUDO CLASSES</h2>
    <li>A <strong>pseudo-class</strong> in CSS is a <em>keyword</em> added to a <em>selector</em> that specifies a
        special state of the selected element</li>
    <li>Common examples include <strong>:hover</strong>, <strong>:visited</strong>, <strong>:nth-child()</strong>, and
        <strong>:active</strong>
    </li>
    <li>A common example is to <strong>change the color of a button</strong> when the mouse is <strong>hovering</strong>
        over it! To do this, we need to use a <strong>pseudo-class</strong> in our CSS file. In my example, I used
        <em>button:<strong>hover</strong></em>{...}, and changed the <em>background-color</em> and <em>color</em> of all
        buttons that don't have their <strong>specificity</strong> overridden!</em>
    </li>
    <li>So, to change all <em>buttons</em> so that when the mouse is over them, the <em>background-color</em> changes to
        red and text to white, we use <em>button<strong>:hover</strong>{...}</em>, where ... is the color changes </li>
    <li>Another example is this: <em>input</em>[<em>type="radio"</em>]<strong>:checked</strong>{...} In this, all inputs
        of type radio that have been checked will have specific attributes adjusted (usually some kind of
        <em>box-shadow</em>)
    </li>
    <li>Finally, <strong>:nth-of-type()</strong> is very useful. Plugging in a number, e.g.
        <em>p</em><strong>:nth-of-type(2)</strong>{...} will simply changed the 2nd p-element among siblings of type p.
        However, <em>p</em><strong>:nth-of-type(2n)</strong>{...} will change <strong>every 2nd</strong> element among
        siblings of type p
    </li>
    <h2>Briefly, pseudo-elements</h2>
    <li>A <strong>pseudo-element</strong> in CSS is a keyword added to a selector that allows you to style a specific
        part of the selected element(s)</li>
    <li>Common examples include <strong>::before</strong>, <strong>::after</strong>, <strong>::selection</strong>,
        <strong>::first-line</strong>, and <strong>::first-letter</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Within this page, my example involves having the <em>first letter</em> of <strong>every</strong> <em>h2</em> tag
        on the page be resized to 36px: <em>h2</em><strong>::first-letter</strong>{...}</li>
    <li>In addition, the <strong>::selection</strong>{...} standalone code in my CSS file made it so that most selected
        text is red and gold</li>
    <li>The parts that differ are for any text selected with a <em>h2</em>: inspect to see why!</li>
    <h2>Specificity</h2>
    <li>This is quite an easy concept. Basically:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>ID > Class > Element > Universal (Class includes pseudo-classes, Element includes pseudo-elements)</li>
        <li>The common tiebreaker is to count the number of each type, with precedence given the highest leftmost type
        </li>
        <li>If there are an identical number of classes/ids/pseudo-things/etc..., then the LAST one read as input (i.e.
            the last one entered in the stylesheet, or the last one of the last-entered stylesheet in the head section)
            will take precedence!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>One thing to note is that <strong>inline styles</strong> have higher specificity than ids! For example,
        something like &lt;<em>button</em>&gt; <strong>style="color:coral"</strong>&gt; will trump any number of ids,
        classes or elements associated with a button in the CSS stylesheet. They're avoided because they can cause
        serious confusion</li>
    <li>On the topic of confusion, the <strong>!important</strong> exception is an example of <em>bad practice</em>.
        When the <strong>!important</strong> rule is used on a style declaration, it signals to the browser that the
        specific declaration should override ANY other declarations. Why is it bad practice? Simply, it makes things
        difficult to debug, as it <strong>breaks the cascading between stylesheets!</strong></li>
    <li>Finally, this link which helps to compare specificity might be very useful: <a
            href="specificity.keegan.st">Compare Specificities Here</a></li>
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <li>This should be an intuitive concept for you!</li>
