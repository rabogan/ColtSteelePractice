                <h2>JavaScript Functions: The Basics</h2>
                <p>It's fairly easy, having already studied functions in C++, to see new functions (no matter what the
                    number of arguments) in JavaScript. The key differences I noticed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We don't need to define a <strong>type</strong> in functions (as I've seen so far)</li>
                    <li>The arguments don't need to have their return type included before the use of the
                        <strong>function</strong> keyword.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <strong>return</strong> keyword does have a usage, however! We can arbitrarily define
                        values/variables that achieve what we want to yield from the function, and then these
                        variables/values.</li>
                    <li><strong>scope</strong> is another topic about which my C++ study has already familiarized me
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following quiz on scope has had the CSS and JavaScript stolen from one of the answers posted <a
                        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61302125/hiding-answers-to-questions-using-javascript">here</a>.
                    Without irony, I can say that the code used within the JavaScript is currently beyond my scope!
                <ol>
                    <li>What is printed to the console when this code runs?
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                let animal = "Giant Pacific Octopus";
                                function observe(){
                                    let animal = "Pajama Squid";
                                    console.log(animal);
                                }
                                observe();
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        <button onclick="myFunction()">Show Answer</button>
                        <div style="display: none;">
                            Pajama Squid
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>What is the result of running the following code?
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                const creature = "Common Sea Dragon";
 
                                function scubaDive(){
                                    const creature = "Spanish Dancer"; //A type of sea slug
                                    console.log(creature);
                                }
 
                                scubaDive();
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        <button onclick="myFunction()">Show Answer</button>
                        <div style="display: none;">
                            Spanish Dancer! Remember, the two "creature" variables are not in the same scope! If
                            they
                            were, we would see an error!
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>What two values are printed to the console?
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                let deadlyAnimal = "Blue-Ringed Octopus";

                                function handleAnimal() {
                                let deadlyAnimal = "Scorpionfish";
                                console.log(deadlyAnimal);
                                }
 
                                handleAnimal();
                                console.log(deadlyAnimal)
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        <button onclick="myFunction()">Show Answer</button>
                        <div style="display: none;">
                            Scorpionfish
                            Blue-Ringed Octopus
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>What is the JavaScript used in the Q&A format?
                        <pre></pre>
                        <button onclick="myFunction()">Show Somewhat Advanced JavaScript</button>
                        <div style="display: none;">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
    function myFunction($event) {
        console.log(event);
        let temp = event.target;
        let temp1 = event.target.nextElementSibling;
        console.log(temp);
        console.log(temp1);
        if (temp1.className == "answerBlock") {
        temp1.classList.remove("answerBlock");
        temp.innerHTML = 'Show Answer';
        } else {
        temp1.classList.add("answerBlock");
        temp.innerHTML = 'Hide Answer';
        }
    }</code>
</pre>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <h2>Regarding Scope and const/let/var</h2>
                <p>There's an interesting difference between the use of <strong>var</strong> and
                    <strong>let/const</strong> in JavaScript. If we use <strong>let/const</strong>, our variables
                    generally stay within their scopes: for example, in a for-loop <em>for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++)</em>,
                            the <strong>i</strong> variable wouldn't be accessible outside of the block over which it
                            iterates. However, if we use <em>for(<strong>var</strong> i = 0; i < 4; i++)</em>, we would
                                    be able to output i later (it, presumably, would be 4). I imagine it would also be
                                    possible to further manipulate that particular variable!
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>'var' is function scoped, meaning that a variable declared with 'var' within
                                            a function is only accessible within that function. Variables declared with
                                            'var' are also hoisted, meaning that they are moved to the top of their
                                            scope, and can be accessed before they are declared in the code.</li>
                                        <li>'const' is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned, while 'let'
                                            is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned. Both 'const' and 'let'
                                            are block scoped, meaning that a variable declared with 'const' or 'let'
                                            within a block is only accessible within that block.</li>
                                        <li>In modern JavaScript, it is generally recommended to use 'const' by default,
                                            and only use 'let' when you know a variable needs to be reassigned. 'var' is
                                            not considered best practice in modern JavaScript, and it is recommended to
                                            avoid using it.</li>
                                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Function Expressions</h2>
                <p>In JavaScript, functions are considered as values! In this language, we can return functions as
                    values, just as we return numbers!</p>
                <li>Definition: a <strong>function expression</strong> is a way to define a function and <strong>assign
                        it to a variable</strong>.</li>
                <li>The most basic example is shown in the code below. Notice how a function expression can be
                    anonymous, or it can have a named identifier. An anonymous function expression is a function without
                    a name, and it is usually assigned to a variable like so:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            const add = function(a, b) {
                                return a + b;
                            };
                            console.log(add(1, 2)); 
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    So, we created a <strong>function expression</strong> and assigned it to the variable
                    <strong>add</strong>. In this example, the function <strong>function(a, b) { return a + b;
                        }</strong> is an anonymous
                    function expression, and it is assigned to the variable add. This function can be invoked by calling
                    add(1, 2), which would return 3.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A named function expression is a function that has a name, and it is also assigned to a variable.
                    The name of the function is only accessible within the function's scope.
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            let multiply = function multiply(a, b) {
                                return a * b;
                            }                            
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    In this example, the function function <strong>multiply(a, b) { return a * b; }</strong> is a
                    <strong>named function
                        expression</strong>, and it is assigned to the variable multiply. This function can be invoked
                    by calling
                    multiply(2, 3), which would return 6. It is important to note that a <strong>named function
                        expression
                        cannot be invoked before it is defined</strong>,
                    unlike function declaration.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Function Expressions</strong> are commonly used in JavaScript when a function is defined
                    <strong>inside another function</strong>, or if the <strong>function is used only in a specific
                        scope.</strong> It is also useful when <strong>you want want to assign a function to a
                        variable</strong> and pass it as an argument to another function or return it from a function.
                </li>
                <li>Advanced Topic 1: <strong>Function expressions</strong> could also be used with
                    <strong>IIFE(Immediately-Invoked Function
                        Expressions)</strong> which allows us to execute a function immediately after it is defined.
                </li>
                <li>Advanced Topic 2a: Another way of writing function expressions is by using the <strong>arrow
                        function
                        notation</strong>, which is more concise and also introduced in <strong>ECMAScript 6
                        (ES6)</strong>. Here is an example of the
                    same function expression written with arrow function notation:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            <strong>const sum = (a, b) => a + b;</strong>
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                <li>Advanced Topic 2b: Function expressions are used frequently in JavaScript, and one of the most
                    common use cases is to pass a function as an argument to another function, like
                    <strong>setTimeout</strong> or
                    <strong>Array.prototype.map</strong>. They also can be used for creating <strong>closures</strong>
                    (see next point!), creating
                    functions on the fly, or
                    to use it as a return value.
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
                            const divide = (a, b) => a / b;
                            const calculator = (a, b, operator) => operator(a, b);
                            console.log(calculator(2,3,multiply))
                            console.log(calculator(10,5,divide))    
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    In this example, we defined two functions multiply and divide as function expressions, and then we
                    defined another function calculator which takes 3 arguments a, b and operator which is a function,
                    and it applies the function to a and b and return the result.
                </li>
                <li>Advanced Topic 3: In JavaScript, a closure is <strong>a function that has access to the variables in
                        its
                        parent scope</strong>, even after the parent function has returned.

                    A <strong>closure is created when a function is defined inside another function</strong>, and the
                    <strong>inner function has
                        access to the variables of the outer function</strong>. Here is an example:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            function outerFunction(x) {
                                let innerVariable = x;
                              
                                return function innerFunction() {
                                  console.log(innerVariable);
                                }
                              }
                              
                              const myClosure = outerFunction(10);
                              myClosure(); // logs "10"                              
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    In this example, the outerFunction takes in a parameter x and assigns it to the variable
                    innerVariable. Then it returns the function innerFunction <strong>which has access to the
                        innerVariable</strong> and
                    it <strong>logs the innerVariable value</strong> when we call it.

                    We assigned the outerFunction to the variable myClosure and when we call myClosure() it returns the
                    innerFunction and logs the innerVariable value which is 10.

                    Closures are useful for a number of different tasks, such as:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Creating private variables</strong> that can only be accessed by privileged
                            functions.</li>
                        <li>Creating function factories that <strong>return different functions with different
                                behavior</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Implementing data privacy and <strong>encapsulation</strong></li>
                        <li>Creating and returning function with an already set context or scope.</li>
                    </ol>
                    In the above example we are <strong>using a closure to create a factory function</strong> that
                    returns a new function
                    that has access to the innerVariable of the outer function, even after the outer function has
                    returned.
                </li>
                <h2>Higher Order Functions</h2>
                <p>A higher order function is a function that <strong>takes one or more functions as arguments, and/or
                        returns a
                        function as its result.</strong></p>
                <p>In JavaScript, functions are <strong>first-class citizens</strong>, meaning that they can be treated
                    just like any
                    other data type, such as a number or a string. This means that you can <strong>pass functions as
                        arguments
                        to other functions</strong>, <strong>return functions as the result of other functions</strong>,
                    and <strong>assign them to variables</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>Let's look at a simple example:
                <pre>
                        <code>
                            function callTwice(func){
                                func();
                                func();
                            }

                            function rollDie(){
                                const roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
                                console.log(roll);
                            }

                            callTwice(rollDie);
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                Here, we're passing the rollDie function as an argument. <strong>Important: we use rollDie<s>()</s>,
                    rather than use parentheses</strong>! We don't want to pass the return value from the function we're
                passing: rather, we pass the function itself, which is then called by the calling function! The above
                example executes the rollDie() function twice.
                </p>
                <h2>Higher Order Functions: Returning Functions</h2>
                <p>So, a higher-order function can also <strong>return a function!</strong>. Here's another example of a
                    simple higher-order function that takes <strong>a function and
                        a number as arguments</strong>, and returns a new function that multiplies the number by the
                    result of the
                    original function:
                <pre>
                        <code>
                            function multiplyBy(factor) {
                                return function(number) {
                                  return number * factor;
                                };
                              }
                              
                              const double = multiplyBy(2);
                              console.log(double(5)); // logs 10                              
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                In this example, <strong>multiplyBy</strong> is a higher-order function because it takes a function as
                an argument (in
                this case, the function is just <strong>number</strong>) and returns a new function as its result. We
                assigned the
                returned function to the variable <strong>double</strong> and when we call <strong>double(5)</strong> it
                returns <strong>5*2=10</strong>

                Higher-order functions are a powerful feature of JavaScript and are used frequently in functional
                programming. They allow you to write reusable and composable code that can be easily understood, tested,
                and maintained. Some examples of higher-order functions that you might use in JavaScript include
                <strong>Array.prototype.map</strong>, <strong>Array.prototype.filter</strong>,
                <strong>Array.prototype.reduce</strong> and <strong>setTimeout</strong> which take a function
                as an argument and returns a new function as a result.

                In summary, a higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments
                or returns a function as a result. They allow you to write reusable and composable code and are widely
                used in JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>In the course, the following example is used:
                <pre>
                        <code>
                        function makeMysteryFunc(){
                            const rand = Math.random();
                            if(rand>0.5){
                                return function(){
                                    console.log('Congrats!  I'm a good function!');
                                    console.log('You win a million dollars!');
                                }
                            }else{
                                return function(){
                                    alert('Uh oh!  You have been infected by a virus!');
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                }
                            }
                        }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                So, using something like:
                <pre>
                        <code>
                            let mystery = makeMysteryFunc();
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                ...would allow us to <strong>call</strong> mystery() itself, and see what we got: the function was
                returned by the makeMysteryFunc function!
                </p>
                <p>A better example is illustrated with this function:
                <pre>
                        <code>
                            function makeBetweenFunct(min,max){
                                return function(num){
                                    return num>=min && num<=max;
                                }
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                This function takes in two arguments (min and max), and return a function that can be used to verify if
                a value falls between the specified min and max values.
                For example, we could define some specific age ranges (ages correct in 2023*) like so:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        <s>function</s> (note how the keyword isn't needed)
                        <s>function</s> const genAlpha = makeBetweenFunct(0,13);
                        const genZ = makeBetweenFunct(14,26);
                        const millenial = makeBetweenFunct(27,42);
                        const genX = makeBetweenFunct(43,58);
                        const boomer = makeBetweenFunct(59,77);
                        const silentGen = makeBetweenFunct(78,94);
                        const greatestGen = makeBetweenFunct(95,120);
                    </code>
                </pre>
                We can call these various functions, and check out what they return!
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        genZ(25) <em>returns true!</em>
                        millenial(44) <em>false</em>
                        genX(69) <em>false</em>
                        boomer(100) <em>false</em>
                        silentGen(92) <em>true</em>
                        greatestGen(37) <em>false</em>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                </p>
                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <p>In JavaScript, a <strong>method</strong> is a function that is a property of an object. In C++, a
                    <strong>member function</strong> is found in a class, and is similar! Both define behavior for
                    objects, and they can be called on an instance of the class or object! (But let's focus on the
                    JavaScript!!!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, you can define a method as a property of an object, like this:
                <pre>
                        <code>
                            <strong>const myObject = {
                                myMethod: function() {
                                    // method logic here
                                }
                            };</strong>

                            ANOTHER EXAMPLE:
                            const myMath = {
                                PI:3.14159;
                                square:function(num){
                                    return num*num;
                                }<strong>,</strong>
                                cube:function(num){
                                    return num*num*num;  (Or num**3) ** being like ^
                                }
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                We can call these using myMath.PI (as one example), or myMath.square(5) (giving, hopefully, 25!).
                </p>
                <p>One key thing: <strong>objects</strong> are everywhere in JavaScript! An array is, by itself,
                    technically an object!</p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Define an object called <strong>square</strong>, which will hold methods that have to do with
                        the geometry of
                        squares. It should contain two methods, <strong>area</strong> and <strong>perimeter</strong>.
                        <strong>area</strong> should accept the length of a
                        side (all sides are the same in a square) and then return the side squared.
                        <strong>perimeter</strong> should
                        accept the length of a <strong>side</strong> and return that side multiplied by 4.
