                <h2>JavaScript Functions: The Basics</h2>
                <p>Differences between C++ and JavaScript functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No <strong>type</strong> needs to be defined in JavaScript functions - neither in the
                        <strong>signature</strong>, nor among the <strong>arguments!</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>The <strong>return <em>keyword</em></strong> is used! Most commonly, we define
                        values/variables to achieve what we want to yield from the function, and then
                        <strong>return</strong> them.
                    </li>
                    <li>While not a difference, it is very common to pass a function as an argument in JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Quick Quiz: Scope in JavaScript</h4>
                <p>The code for the <strong>Show Answer</strong> below is from one of the answers
                    posted <a
                        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61302125/hiding-answers-to-questions-using-javascript">here</a>.
                    The code used in the JavaScript file is currently (slightly) beyond my scope!
                <ol>
                    <li>What is printed to the console when this code runs?
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                let animal = "Giant Pacific Octopus";
                                function observe(){
                                    let animal = "Pajama Squid";
                                    console.log(animal);
                                }
                                observe();</code>
                            </pre>
                        <button onclick="myFunction()">Show Answer</button>
                        <div style="display: none;">
                            Pajama Squid
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>What is the result of running the following code?
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                const creature = "Common Sea Dragon";
 
                                function scubaDive(){
                                    const creature = "Spanish Dancer"; //A type of sea slug
                                    console.log(creature);
                                }
 
                                scubaDive();</code>
                        </pre>
                        <button onclick="myFunction()">Show Answer</button>
                        <div style="display: none;">
                            Spanish Dancer! Remember, the two "creature" variables are not in the same scope! If
                            they
                            were, we would see an error!
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>What two values are printed to the console?
                        <pre>
                            <code>

                                }
 
                                handleAnimal();

                        <div style="display: none;">

                                <code>

        console.log(event);
        let temp = event.target;
        let temp1 = event.target.nextElementSibling;
        console.log(temp);
        console.log(temp1);
        if (temp1.className == "answerBlock") {
        temp1.classList.remove("answerBlock");

                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <h2>Regarding Scope and const/let/var</h2>
                <p>There's an interesting difference between the use of <strong>var</strong> and
                    <strong>let/const</strong> in JavaScript. If we use <strong>let/const</strong>, our variables
                    generally stay within their scopes. For example, in a for-loop <em>for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++)</em>,
                            the <strong>i</strong> variable wouldn't be accessible outside of the block over which it
                            iterates. However, if we use <em>for(<strong>var</strong> i = 0; i < 4; i++)</em>, we would
                                    be able to output i later (it, presumably, would be 4).
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>'var' is <strong>function-scoped</strong>, meaning that a variable declared
                                            with 'var' within
                                            a function is only accessible within that function. Variables declared with
                                            'var' are also <strong>hoisted</strong>, meaning that they are moved to the
                                            top of their
                                            scope, and can be accessed before they are declared in the code.</li>
                                        <li><strong>'const'</strong> is used to declare a variable that cannot be
                                            reassigned, while <strong>'let'</strong>
                                            is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned. Both 'const' and 'let'
                                            are <strong>block scoped</strong>, meaning that a variable declared with
                                            'const' or 'let'
                                            within a block is only accessible within that block.</li>
                                        <li>In modern JavaScript, it is generally recommended to <strong>use 'const' by
                                                default</strong>,
                                            and only <strong>use 'let' when you know a variable needs to be
                                                reassigned</strong>. 'var' is
                                            not considered best practice in modern JavaScript, and it is recommended to
                                            avoid using it.</li>
                                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Function Expressions</h2>
                <p>In JavaScript, functions are considered as values! In this language, we can return functions as
                    values, just as we return numbers!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: a <strong>function expression</strong> is a way to define a function and
                        <strong>assign
                            it to a variable</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>The most basic example is shown in the code below. Notice how a function expression can be
                        anonymous, or it can have a named identifier. An anonymous function expression is a function
                        without
                        a name, and it is usually assigned to a variable like below. So, we created a <strong>function
                            expression</strong> and assigned it to the variable
                        <strong>add</strong>. In this example, the function <strong>function(a, b) { return a + b;
                            }</strong> is an anonymous
                        function expression, and it is assigned to the variable add. This function can be invoked by
                        calling
                        add(1, 2), which would return 3.
                        <pre>
                        <code>
                            const add = function(a, b) {
                                return a + b;
                            };
                            console.log(add(1, 2)); </code>
                    </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A named function expression is a function that has a name, and it is also assigned to a
                        variable.
                        The name of the function is only accessible within the function's scope. In this example, the
                        function function <strong>multiply(a, b) { return a * b; }</strong> is a
                        <strong>named function
                            expression</strong>, and it is assigned to the variable multiply. This function can be
                        invoked
                        by calling
                        multiply(2, 3), which would return 6. It is important to note that a <strong>named function
                            expression
                            cannot be invoked before it is defined</strong>,
                        unlike function declaration.
                        <pre>
                        <code>
                            let multiply = function multiply(a, b) {
                                return a * b;
                            }</code>
                    </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Function Expressions</strong> are commonly used in JavaScript when a function is defined
                        <strong>inside another function</strong>, or if the <strong>function is used only in a specific
                            scope.</strong> It is also useful when <strong>you want want to assign a function to a
                            variable</strong> and pass it as an argument to another function or return it from a
                        function.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Function Expressions: Advanced Topics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Advanced Topic 1: <strong>Function expressions</strong> could also be used with
                        <strong>IIFE(Immediately-Invoked Function
                            Expressions)</strong> which allows us to execute a function immediately after it is defined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Advanced Topic 2a: Another way of writing function expressions is by using the <strong>arrow
                            function
                            notation</strong>, which is more concise and also introduced in <strong>ECMAScript 6
                            (ES6)</strong>. Here is an example of the
                        same function expression written with arrow function notation:
                        <pre>
                        <code>
                            <strong>const sum = (a, b) => a + b;</strong></code>
                    </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Advanced Topic 2b: Function expressions are used frequently in JavaScript, and one of the most
                        common use cases is to pass a function as an argument to another function, like
                        <strong>setTimeout</strong> or
                        <strong>Array.prototype.map</strong>. They also can be used for creating
                        <strong>closures</strong>
                        (see next point!), creating
                        functions on the fly, or
                        to use it as a return value. In this example, we defined two functions multiply and divide as
                        function expressions, and then
                        we
                        defined another function calculator which takes 3 arguments a, b and operator which is a
                        function,
                        and it applies the function to a and b and return the result.
                        <pre>
                        <code>
                            const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
                            const divide = (a, b) => a / b;
                            const calculator = (a, b, operator) => operator(a, b);
                            console.log(calculator(2,3,multiply))
                            console.log(calculator(10,5,divide))</code>
                    </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Advanced Topic 3: In JavaScript, a closure is <strong>a function that has access to the
                            variables in
                            its
                            parent scope</strong>, even after the parent function has returned.

                        A <strong>closure is created when a function is defined inside another function</strong>, and
                        the
                        <strong>inner function has
                            access to the variables of the outer function</strong>. Here is an example:
                        <pre>
                        <code>
                            function outerFunction(x) {
                                let innerVariable = x;
                              
                                return function innerFunction() {
                                  console.log(innerVariable);
                                }
                              }
                              
                              const myClosure = outerFunction(10);
                              myClosure(); // logs "10"</code>
                    </pre>
                        In this example, the outerFunction takes in a parameter x and assigns it to the variable
                        innerVariable. Then it returns the function innerFunction <strong>which has access to the
                            innerVariable</strong> and
                        it <strong>logs the innerVariable value</strong> when we call it.

                        We assigned the outerFunction to the variable myClosure and when we call myClosure() it returns
                        the
                        innerFunction and logs the innerVariable value which is 10.

                        Closures are useful for a number of different tasks, such as:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Creating private variables</strong> that can only be accessed by privileged
                                functions.</li>
                            <li>Creating function factories that <strong>return different functions with different
                                    behavior</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Implementing data privacy and <strong>encapsulation</strong></li>
                            <li>Creating and returning function with an already set context or scope.</li>
                        </ol>
                        In the above example we are <strong>using a closure to create a factory function</strong> that
                        returns a new function
                        that has access to the innerVariable of the outer function, even after the outer function has
                        returned.
                    </li>
                    <h2>Higher Order Functions</h2>
                    <p>A higher order function is a function that <strong>takes one or more functions as arguments,
                            and/or
                            returns a
                            function as its result.</strong></p>
                    <p>In JavaScript, functions are <strong>first-class citizens</strong>, meaning that they can be
                        treated
                        just like any
                        other data type, such as a number or a string. This means that you can <strong>pass functions as
                            arguments
                            to other functions</strong>, <strong>return functions as the result of other
                            functions</strong>,
                        and <strong>assign them to variables</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's look at a simple example:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            function callTwice(func){
                                func();
                                func();
                            }

                            function rollDie(){
                                const roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
                                console.log(roll);
                            }

                            callTwice(rollDie);
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    Here, we're passing the rollDie function as an argument. <strong>Important: we use rollDie<s>()</s>,
                        rather than use parentheses</strong>! We don't want to pass the return value from the function
                    we're
                    passing: rather, we pass the function itself, which is then called by the calling function! The
                    above
                    example executes the rollDie() function twice.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Higher Order Functions: Returning Functions</h2>
                    <p>So, a higher-order function can also <strong>return a function!</strong>. Here's another example
                        of a
                        simple higher-order function that takes <strong>a function and
                            a number as arguments</strong>, and returns a new function that multiplies the number by the
                        result of the
                        original function:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            function multiplyBy(factor) {
                                return function(number) {
                                  return number * factor;
                                };
                              }
                              
                              const double = multiplyBy(2);
                              console.log(double(5)); // logs 10                              
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    In this example, <strong>multiplyBy</strong> is a higher-order function because it takes a function
                    as
                    an argument (in
                    this case, the function is just <strong>number</strong>) and returns a new function as its result.
                    We
                    assigned the
                    returned function to the variable <strong>double</strong> and when we call
                    <strong>double(5)</strong> it
                    returns <strong>5*2=10</strong>

                    Higher-order functions are a powerful feature of JavaScript and are used frequently in functional
                    programming. They allow you to write reusable and composable code that can be easily understood,
                    tested,
                    and maintained. Some examples of higher-order functions that you might use in JavaScript include
                    <strong>Array.prototype.map</strong>, <strong>Array.prototype.filter</strong>,
                    <strong>Array.prototype.reduce</strong> and <strong>setTimeout</strong> which take a function
                    as an argument and returns a new function as a result.

                    In summary, a higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as
                    arguments
                    or returns a function as a result. They allow you to write reusable and composable code and are
                    widely
                    used in JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the course, the following example is used:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                        function makeMysteryFunc(){
                            const rand = Math.random();
                            if(rand>0.5){
                                return function(){
                                    console.log('Congrats!  I'm a good function!');
                                    console.log('You win a million dollars!');
                                }
                            }else{
                                return function(){
                                    alert('Uh oh!  You have been infected by a virus!');
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                    alert('Stop trying to close this window!')
                                }
                            }
                        }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    So, using something like:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            let mystery = makeMysteryFunc();
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    ...would allow us to <strong>call</strong> mystery() itself, and see what we got: the function was
                    returned by the makeMysteryFunc function!
                    </p>
                    <p>A better example is illustrated with this function:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            function makeBetweenFunct(min,max){
                                return function(num){
                                    return num>=min && num<=max;
                                }
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    This function takes in two arguments (min and max), and return a function that can be used to verify
                    if
                    a value falls between the specified min and max values.
                    For example, we could define some specific age ranges (ages correct in 2023*) like so:
                    <pre>
                    <code>
                        <s>function</s> (note how the keyword isn't needed)
                        <s>function</s> const genAlpha = makeBetweenFunct(0,13);
                        const genZ = makeBetweenFunct(14,26);
                        const millenial = makeBetweenFunct(27,42);
                        const genX = makeBetweenFunct(43,58);
                        const boomer = makeBetweenFunct(59,77);
                        const silentGen = makeBetweenFunct(78,94);
                        const greatestGen = makeBetweenFunct(95,120);
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    We can call these various functions, and check out what they return!
                    <pre>
                    <code>
                        genZ(25) <em>returns true!</em>
                        millenial(44) <em>false</em>
                        genX(69) <em>false</em>
                        boomer(100) <em>false</em>
                        silentGen(92) <em>true</em>
                        greatestGen(37) <em>false</em>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Methods</h2>
                    <p>In JavaScript, a <strong>method</strong> is a function that is a property of an object. In C++, a
                        <strong>member function</strong> is found in a class, and is similar! Both define behavior for
                        objects, and they can be called on an instance of the class or object! (But let's focus on the
                        JavaScript!!!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In JavaScript, you can define a method as a property of an object, like this:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            <strong>const myObject = {
                                myMethod: function() {
                                    // method logic here
                                }
                            };</strong>

                            ANOTHER EXAMPLE:
                            const myMath = {
                                PI:3.14159;
                                square:function(num){
                                    return num*num;
                                }<strong>,</strong>
                                cube:function(num){
                                    return num*num*num;  (Or num**3) ** being like ^
                                }
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    We can call these using myMath.PI (as one example), or myMath.square(5) (giving, hopefully, 25!).
                    </p>
                    <p>One key thing: <strong>objects</strong> are everywhere in JavaScript! An array is, by itself,
                        technically an object!</p>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Define an object called <strong>square</strong>, which will hold methods that have to do
                            with
                            the geometry of
                            squares. It should contain two methods, <strong>area</strong> and
                            <strong>perimeter</strong>.
                            <strong>area</strong> should accept the length of a
                            side (all sides are the same in a square) and then return the side squared.
                            <strong>perimeter</strong> should
                            accept the length of a <strong>side</strong> and return that side multiplied by 4.
                            <pre></pre>
                            <button onclick="myFunction()">Show Answer</button>

                    <h2>The <em>this</em> keyword</h2>
                    <p><strong>this</strong> refers to the object that the current function or method is operating on.
                        It is often used to access properties and methods of said current object.</p>
                    <p>In this example, the 'sayHello' method uses the <strong>this</strong> keyword to access the
                        <strong>name</strong> property of the <strong>person</strong> object, and prints 'Hello, my name
                        is Bobby'
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>

                                age: 25,
                                sayHello: function() {
                                    console.log('Hello, my name is '' + this.name);
                                }
                            };
                            
                            person.sayHello(); // Output: 'Hello, my name is Bobby'                            
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>Unfortunately, it's not all that simple! <strong>this</strong>'s value changes depending on
                        <strong>how the function is called.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <li>When a function is called a <strong>method of an object</strong>, <strong>this</strong> refers
                        to the object!</li>
                    <li>When a function is called as a <strong>standalone function</strong>, <strong>this</strong>
                        refers to the global object: in the browser, this is the <strong>window</strong> object.</li>
                    <h2>The Window Object?</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>window object</strong> can be thought of as the <strong>browser window.</strong> It's
                        the blobal object in web browsers, and is automatically created by the browser: and available to
                        <strong>all JS code</strong> running on the page.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <strong>window object</strong> refers to various browser-related functionalities, such as the
                        URL, web page's history, and the ability to create/manipulate browser windows and dialogs.</p>
                    <p>It also provides access to the <strong>document object</strong>, which represents the web page's
                        <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>, and allows you to manipulate the elements of the
                        page.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, this code uses <strong>window.location</strong> to redirect the browser to a new
                        URL:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            window.location = "https://www.backToWorkQuick.com";
                        </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This one uses the <strong>window.alert()</strong> method to display an alert dialog with a
                        message:
                    <pre>
                            <code>
                                window.alert("Greetings Friend!");
                            </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>NOTE: <strong>window</strong> is only available in the browser environment, and not in other JS
                        environments like node.js</p>
                    <h2>Try/Catch: Error Handling</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>try...catch statement</strong> is comprised of a <strong>try block</strong> and
                        either a <strong>catch block</strong>, a <strong>finally block</strong>,
                        or <strong>both</strong>. The code in the <strong>try block</strong> is executed first, and if
                        it throws an exception, the code in
                        the catch block will be executed. The code in the <strong>finally block</strong> will always be
                        executed before
                        control flow exits the entire construct.</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            try {
                                nonExistentFunction();
                              } catch (error) {
                                console.error(error);
                                // Expected output: ReferenceError: nonExistentFunction is not defined
                                // (Note: the exact output may be browser-dependent)
                              }
